# RF4-Hotspot-Helper
The Mofobills RF4 Hotspot Helper

So I'm developing this hotspot helper for people to keep track of their fishing spots.
It has all the latest maps, unlike any I've come across thus far. Even RK has the old 
Kuori map.
Anyway, you can add hotspots, and enter all the relevant info for each, and then display
either all of them on a map or choose a fish from the image list to show all the hotspots
that you can catch that particular fish from.
Obviously hotspots can be edited and deleted also.

I'm working on adding all the baits and lures in future releases, plus if it proves 
popular at all I may have the database online so people can compare spots etc.

Initially I've made the first three maps available without a registration code, as 
the project has taken way longer than I imagined, and adding stuff later and listening to 
user requests is obviously going to take more time. 

I think it's reasonably priced at just Â£5gbp, but if enough people are interested I may lower that.

Anyway, let me know what you all think, and if it's at all useful.
